### Hi there üëã

My name is Herman, I'm a Junior Software Engineer at EPAM Systems. Things I'm passionately driven by are Java (seeking for possibility to join JCP in future), effective delivery, deep dive into programming issues (e.g. why only `Throwable` and its subclasses can be thrown and how to change it?), work process automation (e.g. a script for full Linux setup and customization) and self-education.

Besides programming I have a successful 6-year background experience as a Real Estate Development Lawyer and 2-year - as a Conference Center Manager.
